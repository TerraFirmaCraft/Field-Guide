Holding  while hovering over a draining mold or vessel makes it drain faster. Molds or other fluid containers can also be placed in the output slot, and will be slowly filled with the current content of the crucible.", "entry": "\ub3c4\uac00\ub2c8", "url": "./mechanics/crucible.html"}, {"content": "\ub3c4\uac00\ub2c8\uc758 \uc628\ub3c4 \uac8c\uc774\uc9c0\ub294 \uc22f\ubd88 \ub178 \ub4f1 \uc544\ub798\ucabd\uc758 \uc5f4\uc6d0, \ub610\ub294 \uc704\ucabd\uc758 \uc6a9\uad11\ub85c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac00\uc5f4\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae08\uc18d\uc774 \ub179\uc544\uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uac00\ub2c8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubf51\uc544\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uac00\ub2c8\ub294 \ubd80\uc11c\uc84c\uc744 \ub54c \ub0b4\uc6a9\ubb3c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba70, \ub0b4\ubd80\uc758 \uae08\uc18d\uc744 \ub3c4\uac00\ub2c8\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ub2e4\ub978 \uacf3\uc73c\ub85c \uc62e\uae38 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "entry": "\ub3c4\uac00\ub2c8", "url": "./mechanics/crucible.html"}, {"content": "", "entry": "\ub3c4\uac00\ub2c8", "url": "./mechanics/crucible.html"}, {"content": "\ud569\uae08\uc740 2\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uae08\uc18d\uc744 \uc11e\uc5b4\uc11c \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae08\uc18d\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\ub9ac\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \ucd08\ubc18\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uae08\uc18d\uc774\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc74c \ud2f0\uc5b4\uc758 \uae08\uc18d\uc740 3\uac00\uc9c0 \uc885\ub958\uc758 \uad6c\ub9ac \ud569\uae08\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uae08\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae08\uc18d\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uace0, \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uae08\uc18d\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc911 \ud2b9\uc815 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "entry": "\uae30\ucd08 \ud569\uae08", "url": "./getting_started/primitive_alloys.html"}, {"content": "\uac8c\uc784 \ucd08\ubc18\uc5d0 \ud569\uae08\uc744 \uc81c\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ubc95 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \ud56d\uc544\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc8fc\uc870\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub9cc \ud55c \uc885\ub958\uc758 \uae08\uc18d\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac8c \uc544\ub2cc, \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub9de\ucdb0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc591\uc758 \uae08\uc18d \uad11\uc11d\ub4e4\uc744 \uc791\uc740 \ud56d\uc544\ub9ac \uc548\uc5d0 \ub123\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud569\uae08\uc744 \uc81c\uc791\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "entry": "\uae30\ucd08 \ud569\uae08", "url": "./getting_started/primitive_alloys.html"}, {"content": "\uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4\uc11c, \uccad\ub3d9 1000mB\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\ub824\uba74, (\uc6b0\uce21\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc774\ub4ef\uc774) \uad6c\ub9ac 880mB\uc5d0\uc11c 920mB\uacfc \uc8fc\uc11d 80mB\uc5d0\uc11c 120mB\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\ub2e4\uc74c 3\uc7a5\uc5d0\ub294 2\ud2f0\uc5b4 \uae08\uc18d\ub4e4\uc758 \uc81c\uc791\ubc95\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc885\ub958\uc758 \uae08\uc18d\ub4e4\ub85c\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c, \uac11\uc637, \ub2e4\ub978 \uae08\uc18d \uc544\uc774\ud15c\ub4e4\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac19\uc740 \ud2f0\uc5b4\uc758 \uae08\uc18d\uc774\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ub0b4\uad6c\ub3c4, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uacf5\uaca9 \ud53c\ud574 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc131\uc9c8\uc774 \uc57d\uac04\uc529 \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "entry": "\uae30\ucd08 \ud569\uae08", "url": "./getting_started/primitive_alloys.html"}, {"content": "\ud569\uae08 \ube44\uc728:88 - 92% : \uad6c\ub9ac8 - 12% : \uc8fc\uc11d", "entry": "\uae30\ucd08 \ud569\uae08", "url": "./getting_started/primitive_alloys.html"}, {"content": "\ud569\uae08 \ube44\uc728:20 - 30% : \uc544\uc5f050 - 65% : \uad6c\ub9ac10 - 20% : \ube44\uc2a4\ubb34\ud2b8", "entry": "\uae30\ucd08 \ud569\uae08", "url": "./getting_started/primitive_alloys.html"}, {"content": "\ud569\uae08 \ube44\uc728:50 - 70% : \uad6c\ub9ac10 - 25% : \uc74010 - 25% : \uae08", "entry": "\uae30\ucd08 \ud569\uae08", "url": "./getting_started/primitive_alloys.html"}, {"content": "Utility Alloys", "entry": "\uae30\ucd08 \ud569\uae08", "url": "./getting_started/primitive_alloys.html"}, {"content": "Other alloys are not suitable for creating tools.
